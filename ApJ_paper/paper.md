Computing 2 and 3 pt. correlation functions with `AstroCorr`

We provide
- An empirical benchmarking of the treecorr algorithm in terms of 'accuracy' and speed. 'Accuracy' is naive corr. We benchmark it against `clustercorr` at various granularities
- We release AstroCorr, a julia implementation of treecorr and clustercorr. We explain the engineering / software extensible aspects of our program
